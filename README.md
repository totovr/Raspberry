# Raspberry

The Raspberry Pi is slower than a modern laptop or desktop but is still a complete Linux computer and can provide all the expected abilities that implies, at a low-power consumption level.

For more information check the [Raspberry.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/education/)

This repository contains programs for different applications in Ubuntu Xelenial and Processing 3.3.6

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/#buy-now-modal)
* Micro SD card of 16 (at least)
* A monitor with an HDMI interface
* An HDMI cable
* A USB keyboard
* An Ubuntu Core image
* SD card reader (just in case that your computer has not)
* A computer with OSX, Windows, Linux (To save the OS image in the SD card)

Alternative Hardware:

* Kinect V1

Alternative Software:

* Processing

### Installing

  1. Download Xelenial image, you can download it from this page [Xelenial for Raspberrypi](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-core/16/stable/current/ubuntu-core-16-pi3.img.xz)

  2. Because I have just Mac to install the image, I will use [ETCHER](https://etcher.io/) to write the SO image in the sd card, but also this software is supported for Windows and Linux.

  Select the image of Xelenial that you download previously (I supposed that you already insert the SD card), chose the SD Card and Flash!

  3. Once [ETCHER](https://etcher.io/) end to write the image in the micro SD card you are ready to insert it in the Raspberry and start to configure it as a new toy!

## Also you can use the next software write the image in the micro SD:

* [Pendrivelinux](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/) (For windows and Linux)
* [Partition Wizard](http://www.partitionwizard.jp/index.html) (For Windows)
